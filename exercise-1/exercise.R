# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in each game this
# season (google "Seahawks" for the info!)
points.scored <- c(20, 25, 31, 15, 5, 7, 10, 3, 34, 25, 6, 20)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each game this season
points.against <- c(25, 31, 24, 26, 14, 40, 38, 24, 31, 23, 26, 36)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
data.frame <- data.frame(points.scored, points.against)
View(data.frame)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points.
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
data.frame$diff <- points.scored - points.against

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won
data.frame$won <- points.scored > points.against


# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents


# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
